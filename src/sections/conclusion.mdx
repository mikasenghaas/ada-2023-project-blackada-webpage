## What have we learned?

---

Turns out, navigating the beer aisle isn't as daunting as it seems. Our analysis revealed a shared language among beer styles, with specific descriptors like "roasty" for Stouts or "crisp" for Lagers. Want to sound like a pro? Use terms like "astringency" or "diacetyl" â€“ just don't be surprised if eyes roll.

Beyond the fun, this shared language offers real potential:

* Help newbies choose the perfect pint based on taste preferences.
* Recommend new beers based on your existing vocabulary.
* Build a more inclusive beer community where everyone can join the conversation.

So, next time you raise a glass, remember that you're part of a global beer language choir. Cheers to understanding, discovery, and endless brews!

(P.S. We promise to avoid any more beer puns. Maybe.)

(P.S. Use your newfound vocabulary wisely. Just don't blame us if your friends start rolling their eyes!)
