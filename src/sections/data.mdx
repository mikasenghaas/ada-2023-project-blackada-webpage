## Where Did This Treasure Trove of Beer Reviews Come From?

---

We're lucky to have access to a massive dataset of beer reviews, generously provided by the ADA team. This dataset, originally sourced from the esteemed [BeerAdvocate](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wz6D2FM25ydFw_-41I9uTwG9uNsN4TCF) website, holds a whopping 2.4 million user reviews, covering a staggering 126 thousand unique beers! Talk about a diverse selection to quench any thirst for data.

To make things more manageable (and because we love a good categorization), we've grouped the original 104 beer substyles into 11 broader style categories. While the dataset also includes information about breweries and reviewers, we've kept our focus on the reviews themselves for this analysis.
