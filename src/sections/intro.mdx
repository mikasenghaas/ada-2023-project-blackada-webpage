<span class="text-6xl text-foreground">Who</span> doesn't love a good cold brew on a warm summer's day? Who doesn't crave the sound of the can crackling open, and the spike of fizz on the tongue? Who doesn't long for the perfect pour of a pint into an oversized stein with just enough head? But when you stand at the bar, staring at the choice of beers like a deer in headlights, can you really describe the differences between the options?

Navigating the world of beers can be a daunting task for non-experts.
Beer aficionados often describe brews as having nuanced flavors such as "grassy notes" and "biscuity/crackery malt," with hints of "hay."
But do these descriptions reflect the actual tasting experience? Following a "wisdom-of-the-crowd" approach,
a descriptor can be considered meaningful if many, independent reviewers use similar descriptors for a beer's taste.
To quantify consensus, we use natural language processing techniques to extract descriptors of a beer's taste and
numerically represent these descriptors to compute similarity or consensus scores. The consensus scores between beer reviews will unveil whether there is a shared understanding of taste among beer geeks.

And what if you want to sound like a beer snob to impress your friends? What words should you use to describe which beers? We end our investigations by using interpretable embeddings to identify the most important words to use when describing beers of different qualities.
